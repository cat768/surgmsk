A reimaginging of the surgery and MSK content but in a more appealing way

## GitHub Pages

The repository includes a workflow that uploads the site to GitHub Pages. Any push to `main` will trigger the action defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and publish the current contents of the repository. After the workflow completes, the site will be available from the repository's **Pages** tab.
